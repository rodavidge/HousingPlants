        What is a Web Developer?
    </div>
        <p>In short, web developers create and maintain websites with the client and consumer in mind. The design of the website should include products and services offered and show how users can use them. Web developers can work on both the front and the back end of a website keeping things like layout and functionality in mind and afterwards they make sure that the site continues to be functional throughout different web browsers. They code mainly using HTML5, CSS and JavaScript but can also include other languages like Ruby on Rails and C++.  </p>
